# Password-Generator

# Password Generator

This project contains a simple script that generates random passwords of a specified length. The passwords are generated using a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Getting Started

To use the password generator, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You can then clone or download the repository and run the script using the following command:

$ python password_generator.py


The script will prompt you to enter the desired length of the password, and it will output the generated password.

## Customizing the Password Generation

You can customize the types of characters that are included in the generated passwords by modifying the `characters` string in the script. For example, to only include lowercase letters and numbers, you can set `characters` to `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789'`.

You can also customize the password generation process by modifying the `generate_password` function. For example, you could add additional checks to ensure that the generated password meets certain criteria, such as including at least one uppercase letter and one special character.
